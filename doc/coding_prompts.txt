write a load_tags function to load public.csv to DataFrame df_public and private.csv to df_pvivate. and join them by field "tag" to a df_tags. Note that one or both of them may not exist. df_tags should not be null. df_tags should at leat has following fileds: tag, stance, path, value, lable,translate_cn,comments,weight,statistics. if the field data is nan or null. should set as empty string.

move layout code to init_ui, keep member init code in __init__


write a function named parse_tags, accept a prompt_text as str. Split it by '\n' and strip each line, remove empty lines. For the line 0 and 1, if there's a ':' before any ',', remove the sub string before ':' and ':' it self. split line 0 and 1 by ',' and strip each sub string. line 0 is positive_tags, line 1 is negitive_tags. line 0 not exists, positive_tags should be empty list, same to negitive_tags. The rest lines should be joined by '\n' as extra_data. If no more lines extra_data should be empty string. return positive_tags, negitive_tags, extra_data

write code to handle tables item been dragged to the tree.


add a member function named on_button_edit, with 2 parameters: QTableWidget, edit_row as int. Get data from the table and update to self.tag_database, follow the mapping of COL2FIELD, which index to table column and the value on index as the field of dataframe. The first column value is the unique major key to the dataframe. If the key does not exists, add a new row to dataframe.


positive_tags, negative_tags are list of string. create 2 dataframe for each and put the list data into a row named 'tag'


join positive_df with tag_database by 'tag' row. keep all tag_database columns. if the tag not in tag_database, the columns are empty string. the same to negative_df.





add a dataframe row edit dialog. 
it accepts 4 parameters in its __init__: a dataframe, a field_name_mapping as dict, a unique_field as str, unique_field_value as any.
it has a editable table that has 2 columns: Field, Value and 2 buttons named OK and Cancel. 
use the unique_field and unique_field_value to filter row. if row is empty. create a new dataframe with the same column. set its unique_field as unique_field_value, other fields data are empty string . create a ordered dict from the row data. show this dict to table, which first column shows the key name that mapping from field_name_mapping. the second column shows the dict value.
when user click OK. read data from table and update to dataframe row by unique_field and unique_field_value. if data not exits, append a new row to dataframe.


create a new_df dataframe with the same columns of df. add a new row and set unique_field value as unique_field_value. other fileds are empty string.


database is a dataframe , check if unique_field has unique_field_value in database

write a function named save_tag_data. acceapt a dataframe. Split the dataframe to 2 : if private field == 'Y', to df_private, else to df_public. save df_private to private.csv and save df_public to public.csv


receive the data from table here, it might be multiple rows. get each row's first data.


write a table widget. override mimeData to set the mine data as the selected rows first column data.


in dropEvent(), get the tree node it droped on. caclulate the full path from root to current node. slash as the seperator



update dataframe self.database set the field 'path' as full_path where field 'tag' in list selected_data.


for text, get the first index of ',' as i1 and get the first index of ':' as i2. If i2 >= 0 and i2 < i1, remove the string from text before and include ':'


write a function named analysis_tag. accept 1 parameter named tag as string. Do following check:
If the tag contains ":", then first try to remove the "()" surrounding it. If ":" is followed by a number, then the contents on both sides of ":" are raw_tag and tag_weight respectively

else If the tag contains "|", then raw_tag = tag, tag_weight = 1,

else initialize tag_weight to 1.0, tag is surrounded by '()' each layer, weight * 1.1. tag is surrounded by ‘[]' each layer, weight * 0.9. raw_tag is the content after removing all brackets


finish update_tags_path function. df is a dataframe. tag is a string list. if one item in tag list also in df's tag field. update this row's path field with _path. else insert a row, update the tag field with tag and same to path field.


write a function named backup_file, accept 2 parameters: file_name as str, backup_limit as int.
check and build a folder named 'backup' at the same path of file_name. Copy file_name to this folder and add timestamp (YYYYmmDDHHMMSSsss) before its extension if has, else to be its extension.
After copying file, get the file number that matches this file's backup name from backup folder by using re. If its larger than backup_limit. delete the oldest file, to be judged by the timestamp in file name. not to the file create time.


create a readonly multiple line text to replace reserved_area which named text_comments showing ANALYSIS_README


Write a function named translate df. Accept 3 parameters: df as dataframe,  text_field as str, trans_field as str. For each row call youdao_translate with text_field data and fill the result to trans_field if the trans_field is empty string.



pop up a quest box with yes and no button: 
'''将使用有道对未翻译的tag进行翻译，需要联网。机翻精度有限，仅供参考。
由于采用同步的方式进行网络请求，在翻译过程中界面会无法操作，这是正常现象。
翻译结果不会自动保存。需要对tag进行编辑操作（如双击或拖动分组）后相应的数据才能被保存。

是否继续？
'''
if click no, return.



write a function named update_new_translate_to_database, accept 1 parameters df as dataframe.
'tag' field is the primary key.

set all empty field as empty string.


写一个函数，名字叫update_df_by_dicts，接受3个参数：df ad datafram，data as dict or list of dict, primary_key as str. 根据primary_key，使用data里面对应字段更新df中的内容(如果是list of dict则可能更新多行)，如果data有不存在于df的字段则忽略。注意检查df和dict都包含primary_key


写一系列函数来测试它，叫test_update_df_by_dicts_N，和上面一样考虑各种情况，每种情况一个函数，后缀N为函数的序号。先输出一个函数，我说继续，输出下一个，结束 就说结束。

如果df2不为none，将df2中存在但df1中不存在的列加入df1中。
如果df3不为none，将df3中存在的行从df1中移除
